	"content": "Invoices Serverless Overview The system represents a fully serverless and highly scalable architecture built entirely on AWS cloud services, designed to securely manage user access, handle backend logic, and store data efficiently. At the entry point, Amazon Route 53 is responsible for DNS resolution, directing client requests to the appropriate endpoint. These requests are then passed to Amazon API Gateway, which acts as the centralized interface for all external interactions with the backend. API Gateway not only handles the routing of requests but also enforces security by integrating with Amazon Cognito for user authentication and authorization.\nOnce a user is authenticated, API Gateway forwards the request to specific AWS Lambda functions that contain the core business logic of the application. For example, the scan_lambda function may be responsible for validating, scanning, or preprocessing user inputs, while the savePicture function handles more complex data processing and uploads results to Amazon S3. Amazon S3 serves as the system’s persistent storage layer, offering high durability, availability, and secure access to stored data. The entire system is event-driven, cost-efficient, and capable of scaling automatically based on demand, making it ideal for modern applications that require high availability, low operational overhead, and strong security controls. Additionally, with built-in monitoring, logging, and metrics provided by AWS services like CloudWatch, the system ensures visibility and maintainability across all components without requiring manual server management or infrastructure provisioning. Target No server management – The system scales automatically and is managed without needing to maintain servers.\nHigh security – Ensures only authorized users can access services.\nCost optimization – Pay-as-you-go pricing, with no fixed infrastructure costs.\nHigh performance – Quick processing and automatic adjustment based on traffic volume.\nEasy integration – AWS services work seamlessly together, simplifying development and operations.\n"

	"content": "What is Amazon Bedrock? Amazon Bedrock is a fully managed service that enables you to build and scale generative AI applications quickly and securely, starting with a foundation model (FM) of your choice. It provides access to a variety of leading FMs from top AI providers through a simple API, without the need to manage infrastructure.\nA key feature of Amazon Bedrock is Guardrails, which allows organizations to implement safeguards—referred to as guardrails—that monitor and control both user inputs and AI-generated outputs. These safeguards help ensure that the AI behavior aligns with your organization’s policies and ethical standards. Guardrails are model-agnostic and can be integrated across various use cases and applications.\nWhat is Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock? Guardrails for Amazon Bedrock is a powerful feature that enables you to establish safety controls within your generative AI applications. Guardrails help filter, block, or manage content that may be considered harmful, inappropriate, or misaligned with your organization’s policies.\nThese safeguards work across different foundation models and are designed to ensure responsible use of AI by checking both user inputs and AI outputs. In future updates, Guardrails will also support automatic redaction of personally identifiable information (PII)—further enhancing content safety and privacy.\nWith Guardrails, you can configure and enforce policies such as:\nDenied Topics: Specify topics that are not allowed within your application. Example: A virtual banking assistant can be restricted from giving investment advice.\nContent Filters: Set thresholds to detect and filter content related to: Hate speech, Insults, Sexual content, Violence,\u0026hellip;\n"

	"title": "Creating Denied Topics",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Guardrails can be configured with a set of denied topics that are undesirable in the context of your generative AI application. For example, a bank may want their AI assistant to avoid any conversation related to investment advice or engage in conversations related to cyrptocurrencies.\nYou can define up to 30 denied topics. Input prompts and model completions will be evaluated against each of these denied topics. If one of the denied topics is detected, the blocked message configured as part of the guardrail will be returned to the user.\nDenied topics can be defined by providing a natural language definition of the topic along with a few optional example phrases of the topic. The definition and example phrases are used to detect if an input prompt or a model completion belongs to the topic.\nIn the following section we will configure three types of Denied topics for medical advice, financial advice and political advice.\n"

	"tags": [],

	"content": " In this section you can add optional word filters that you do not want in user inputs or the model responses. It is recommended to check the \u0026ldquo;Profanity Filter\u0026rdquo; to ensure that no abusive words can be used during customer interactions Word filters can be used to block specific words and phrases in both input prompts and model responses. These filters are essential for maintaining the integrity, professionalism, and compliance of interactions, especially in sensitive and regulated environments like banking. These can be added manually or uploaded from a list.\nExamples That Can Be Used:\n\u0026ldquo;suicide\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;self-harm\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;terrorist\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;illegal\u0026rdquo; Add these words and click Next: Click on Next. We do not have any requirements to define PII so click on next below to reach Define blocked messaging section Enable optional contextual grounding check and set to default Click on Next. Review the information and Click on Create Guardrail from the bottom of the page. "
